The Unity package is located in this directory: [Unity-6-php-Server](https://github.com/Blackshot3312/Unity-6-php-Server) 

Note: It was based on Unity 6 LTS, but it will probably work for Unity 5 as there is nothing special about it
The server is based on MAMP, the database login and password are root, root. Inside the Database directory is the Unitysql SQL file, you can import the data or study it to create your own.

MAMP for [Mac](https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/) or MAMP for [Windows](https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/)
